### Hi there, I'm Max (he/him)!

- M.Sc. student of Data Science for Public Policy ('24) at the [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/)
- Research Assistant at CityLab @ [Technologiestiftung Berlin](https://github.com/technologiestiftung)
- I'm interested in using data science to:
  - evaluate the effectiveness of policy, and
  - facilitate digital transformation in the public sector to serve people better and more equitably.
